# IST Event Management System (IST-EMS) Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop the IST Event Management System (IST-EMS), an event management system that facilitates the creation, reservation, and verification of ticket availability for events such as concerts and theatrical performances. The IST-EMS leverages parallelization techniques based on multiple processes and multiple tasks to accelerate order processing.

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in implementing scalable synchronization mechanisms between tasks and inter-process communication using First In, First Out (FIFO) queues and signals.
